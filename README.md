## Notes
Unlike PEP8, this package source codes used **maximum line length=92**, following [Julia code formatting guidelines](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-formatting-guidelines) + **docstring maximum line length = 79**.

**Why "ys"sbtmpy? The name "sbtmpy" is too general, and I believe a better package should take that name, so I decided not to occupy the name. I see many useless packages that preoccupy meaningful names...**
