# yssbtmpy

My personal Python package to do thermal modeling on atmosphereless bodies in the Solar system.

Currently, there is no proper publication deals with the details of the implementation of this package (because it is nothing but a collection of the works by other people, although I implemented them).

## Notes
Unlike PEP8, this package source codes used **maximum line length=92**, following [Julia code formatting guidelines](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#code-formatting-guidelines) + **docstring maximum line length = 79**.

**Why "ys"sbtmpy? The name "sbtmpy" is too general, and I believe a better package should take that name, so I decided not to occupy the name. I see many useless packages that preoccupy meaningful names...**
